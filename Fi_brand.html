    <h2>How It will Make</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px;">
      <p>
        Craft with care and inspired by coastal freshness. At the heart of every bite is <b>Puntius fish</b>, 
        a small yet flavorful freshwater catch known for its tender texture and rich taste. Sourced sustainably, 
        these fish are cleaned, filleted, and transformed into golden, crispy delights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have intent to fry our chips in pure sunflower oil, ensuring a light and healthy crunch that does not 
        weigh you down.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
        <b>Garlic Glaze</b>: Rich, roast garlic with a hint of lemony zing.<br>
        <b>Tomato Zest</b>: Tangy sun-dried tomato with a subtle herby note.<br>
        <b>Smoky BBQ</b>: Deep, smoky spices with a touch of sweetness and fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        To boost both taste and nutrition, we try to sprinkle in a blend of healthy spices such as turmeric 
        (anti-inflammatory), black cumin (kalonji) for its antioxidant kick, and a dash of moringa powder 
        for a superfood twist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our production process maintains strict hygiene standards while preserving the nutritional integrity 
        of the ingredients. The fish is processed within hours of catch to ensure maximum freshness, then 
        carefully prepared, seasoned, and packaged to deliver premium quality in every bag.
