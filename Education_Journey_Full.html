            <h3>Kadamhata Govt. Primary School</h3>
            <p><b>Kadamhata Govt. Primary School</b> is located in the beautiful area of <b>Kadamhata</b>. It is well-acknowledged as a school in an ideal spot, encircled by nature's beauty. With greenish fields and peaceful surroundings, the atmosphere was serene, perfect for instigating a desire to learn among kids. I spent all my elementary classes here, building vibrant memories filled with joy, curiosity, and growth. This is where my education journey began. I learned the basic skills and concepts that laid the foundation for the rest of my educational journey. My mother was working as an assistant teacher at the Kadamhata Govt. Primary School, where I had my student days, so she guided me and helped in every possible manner in my early education. But simultaneously, all the other teachers were equally motivating, great mentors, and a role model who shaped my academics and personal grooming. In 2007, I passed the scholarship examination with excellence and thereby received a general scholarship, which brought immense pride and motivation to me. I still remember my school friend <b>Raju Malakar</b>, whose companionship and friendship made my study sessions both enjoyable and memorable. The hard work and dedication resulted in an <b>A-</b>  grading scale in the <b>PSC (Primary School Certificate)</b> examination, which was possible because of the strong foundation laid by my teachers, family member specially my maternal granny, and friends during those formative years. </p>

            <h2>High School</h2>
            <h3>Rajnagar Ideal High School</h3>
            <p> My high school journey started in 2008 when I applied to several schools through entrance exams, included <b> Rajnagar Ideal High School</b>. Although I passed all the exams, I did exceptionally well at RIHS(Rajnagar Ideal High School). I managed to secure the sixth position, which was a pretty good start for my high school journey in a school known for its strict rules and regulations. The school's disciplined environment and emphasis on excellence in academics formed me in many ways. I had the good fortune to be guided by an exceptional faculty-strong personality and truly dedicated. I would like to mention a few remarkable teachers <b>Shahjahan Chowdhury</b>, <b>Fakhrul Islam</b>, <b>Sirazul Islam Mamun</b> etc whose played a pivotal role in shaping my academic and personal growth. During my high school years, I began to explore subjects in more depth. It was also a time to forge friendships and experience a balance between academic and extracurricular activities. In my high school journey at Rajnagar Ideal High School, I got the opportunity to come across some very special friends who left an indelible mark on my life. Among them <b>Riajul Islam</b>, <b>Mehedi Alam Opu</b>, <b>Suman Ahmed Tushar</b>, <b>Rezaul Karim Tarek</b> etc, whose companionship, support, and shared experiences made those years truly memorable. We studied together, laughed together, and faced challenges as a team, creating bonds that felt unbreakable. The <b>Junior School Certificate (JSC)</b> examination in 2010 was a significant milestone in my academic journey, and it began with a surprising twist—I had to take the exam at another school <b><a href="https://www.rpmhss.edu.bd/" type="text" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;">Rajnagar Porteous Model High School</a> </b> in Rajnagar. This school was notably larger, with expansive grounds and impressive sports fields, which added a unique backdrop to the exam experience. Despite the unfamiliar environment, I approached the exam with focus and determination, completing it spontaneously and giving my best effort. When the results were announced, I was proud to achieve a <b>B</b> grading scale, a testament to my hard work and preparation. This experience not only marked my first major public exam but also taught me the importance of adaptability and staying calm under pressure, lessons that have stayed with me ever since.
                After completing the JSC exam, I faced a challenging decision regarding my program choice. I initially intended to pursue business studies, but it was not available at my school at the time. Determined to follow my interest, I applied for the entrance exam at <b> <a href="http://www.mbghs.edu.bd/" type="text" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;">Moulvibazar Government High School </a></b> and successfully passed it with the help of my tutor. However, my parents were hesitant about admitting me to the school due to security concerns. Ultimately, I chose to continue at my existing school and enrolled in the humanities program for Standard 9 and 10. Despite the initial setback, I dedicated myself to my studies and achieved an outstanding result in my <b>SSC (Secondary School Certificate)</b> examination with <b>A</b> grading scale. This journey taught me resilience and the importance of adapting to circumstances while striving for excellence. Eventually, I completed my <b>10 years</b> of education journey.</p>

            <h2>College</h2>
            <h3>Moulvibazar Govt. College</h3>
            <p>My excellent academic performance helped me get admitted to one of the most renowned colleges in Moulvibazar that <b><a href="https://mbgc.gov.bd/home" type="text" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;">Moulavibazar Govt. College</a></b>. When the time came for subject selection, I had two open options. These are humanities and business studies. After considering my long-cherished fondness for this particular field, I chose to study business studies. Its perfectly fit my decision in line with my aspirations, and I was very excited to undertake the journey in this new academic span. In college, It was a time to further hone my academic skills and develop a clearer vision for my future career. College was both challenging and exciting as I prepared for the two years journey. In the middle of the year 2013, my class began, and I was consistently present throughout the academic sessions. However, one challenge I faced during my studies was that the course contents were heavily based on memorization, which often made me feel bored and disengaged. Despite this, I tried to make the most of my study schedule by finding the ways to stay motivated and enjoyed the learning process. Over time, I adapted to the routine and managed to balance the monotony with moments of genuine interest, making my academic journey a mix of challenges and personal growth. During college, 
                I actively participated in a university decoration and productivity group that allowed me to be socially useful on campus. One of the most memorable moments is when my mate and I were given the responsibility to ensure cleanliness and proper usage of dustbins for debris, which helped maintain a tidy and efficient environment. When the gossips were made on the campus, while most of my school friends had scattered across various departments, leaving only two of us together, I had built strong mutual bonds with my peers in my business department. These connections have enriched my college experience, creating a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose. I had the opportunity to meet with the new faculty members, and it turned out to be another exciting acquaintance with highly accomplished teachers. They had impressive profiles and brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table. However, I noticed that they were often transferred from one place to another, which made it difficult to maintain long-term communication with them. Despite this, all the faculty members were incredibly friendly and approachable, creating a welcoming and supportive environment. Their warmth and dedication made the experience of interacting with them truly memorable. One of the key differences I noticed between school and college was the vibrant celebration of various cultural occasions like <b>Pahela Baishakh</b>, <b>Basanta Utsab</b>, and <b>Pita Utsab</b>. These events were entirely new to me, and I was introduced to them for the first time in college. I enthusiastically participated in these celebrations, embracing the cultural richness and joy they brought. The college itself was nestled in the middle of hills, with a maze-like map that added to its unique charm. I often walked along the roads surrounding the college, enjoying the serene and picturesque environment, which became an integral part of my college experience.
                In 2015, I appeared for my last secondary examination, the <b>HSC (Higher Secondary Certificate)</b>, which marked the culmination of my <b>12 years</b> of education. The exam was held at another campus in Moulvibazar, and I put in my best effort to perform well. After months of preparation and hard work, I successfully completed the exam, achieving a grade of <b>B</b> in letter scale. This milestone not only brought a sense of accomplishment but also fulfilled my long journey of academic dedication and growth. It was a proud moment, signifying the end of one chapter and the beginning of new opportunities ahead.</p>

This university was located in one of the quiet and peaceful places of Sylhet, which provides a very appropriate atmosphere for higher education. This university came into my notice while researching the top-ranked educational institutes of the city. Getting admitted to this institution was one of the major events of my life, and I am privileged to get higher education in such a renowned and peaceful environment. It was where I took a deeper dive into specialized subjects related to my field of study. This stage of my life taught me to think critically, solve complex problems, and focus on my career aspirations.
            In may first at 2016, The first day of university, known as <b>Nabin Baran (a welcoming event for newcomers)</b>, was an exciting and memorable experience. I attended the event with enthusiasm, eager to explore the full program and learn more about my faculty. Initially, I felt a bit nervous about interacting with my teachers, unsure of how to approach them. However, their warm and caring attitude immediately put me at ease, leaving me pleasantly surprised. Their approachable nature helped me overcome my hesitation, and I gradually felt more confident engaging in conversations with them. This positive start set the tone for my journey ahead, making me feel welcomed and supported in my new academic environment. I felt in that university was a transformative period in my educational journey. During my time at university, I had the opportunity to meet and interact with mates from various divisions of the country, each bringing their unique cultural backgrounds, languages, and identities. Engaging with them allowed me to learn about their traditions, dialects, and perspectives, which enriched my understanding of diversity. My batch, <b>Batch 39</b>, was particularly vibrant and open-minded, fostering an environment of inclusivity and mutual respect. This experience not only broadened my horizons but also helped me build lasting connections with people from different walks of life, making my university journey truly memorable and transformative.
            I fondly remember my best professors these are <b>Professor Dr. Mohammad Jamal Uddin</b>, <b>Md. Emran Uddin</b>, <b>Md. Alaul Haque</b>, <b>Md. Ziaur Rahman</b>, <b>Md. Afsarul Islam</b>, <b>Mohammad Asrafuzzaman Yazdani Razu</b>, <b>Chayan Paul</b> whose knew me very well and always made an effort to understand my strengths and areas for improvement. Their classes were incredibly engaging and enjoyable, filled with insightful discussions and practical examples that made learning both informative and pragmatic. Their presence in the classroom had a remarkable impact, as they had a unique ability to simplify complex concepts and connect them to real-world applications. This professor not only inspired me academically but also encouraged me to think critically and creatively, leaving a lasting impression on my educational journey.
            I also remember my class representative <b>Jakowan Joni</b> and other friends are mainly <b>Saiful Islam</b>, <b>Altaf Hussen Abid</b>,<b>Fathema Priya</b>, <b>Shahriar Tanim</b>, <b>Mitu Das</b>, <b>Joy Roy</b>, <b>Shibbir Ahmed</b>, <b>Shefaly Akther</b>, <b>Shuhanur Rahman</b>  whose played a significant role in my academic journey. They were always there to support me, whether it was during group discussions, preparing for presentations, or practicing for viva exams. It was through their guidance and encouragement that I was first introduced to the art of delivering presentations, something I initially found daunting. Their patience and collaborative spirit helped me build confidence and improve my skills over time. Their unwavering support not only made challenging tasks easier but also fostered a sense of teamwork and camaraderie, which I deeply cherish.
            During the middle of our studies in 2018, we celebrated the completion of our second year with an event called <b>First and Fiesta</b>, which turned out to be one of the most stunning experiences for me. The event was filled with playful activities, performances, and unforgettable moments. <b>Shefaly Akther</b> and <b>Fathema Priya</b> mesmerized everyone with their incredible dance performances, while I had the opportunity to participate in a ramp show, which was an outstanding experience shared with my beloved mates. <b>Mr. Nahian Juardar</b> added a poetic touch to the event with his praiseworthy recitation, and <b>Jakowan Joni</b> played a significant role in making the event a success. We organized the celebration at the <b>Food Palace</b>, a party hall adjacent to our university, making it a night to remember filled with joy, laughter, and camaraderie.
            With fond reminiscence, we passed two remarkable years together, filled with not only academic pursuits but also memorable extracurricular activities. Amidst our studies, we embarked on exciting study tours, picnics, and extra outings that brought us closer as a group. These experiences allowed us to explore new places, bond over shared adventures, and create lasting memories outside the classroom. Whether it was the laughter during picnics, the curiosity during study tours, or the joy of spontaneous outings, these moments added a vibrant dimension to our college life, making those two years truly unforgettable. 
            At the beginning of 2019, I was given the opportunity to choose my major from a range of options, including accounting, management, finance, marketing, and tourism. After careful consideration, I decided to pursue <b>Accounting and Information Systems</b>, as it aligned with my interests and career aspirations. Following the selection process, our batch was divided into various departments based on our chosen majors. My classmates and I, who had selected <b>Accounting and Information System</b>, were separated from the rest and began our studies in the <b>Accounting Department</b>. For nearly nine months, we focused on our specialized courses, spending most of our time away from the others. While it was a period of intense academic focus, it also allowed me to build strong connections with my fellow Accounting majors and deepen my knowledge in the field. At the end of 2019, during our last semester, we organized a grand celebration named <b>Adios of BBA 39</b>, marking the farewell of our batch. For the <b>Adios of BBA 39</b> celebration, we put in great effort to decorate the university, transforming it into a vibrant and festive space that reflected the spirit of our farewell. The venue <b>Food Palace</b> was adorned with colorful decorations, lights, and creative displays, creating a warm and celebratory atmosphere. We extended heartfelt invitations to all our faculty members, who had been an integral part of our academic journey. Their presence added a special touch to the event, making it even more meaningful. It was a joyous occasion where we celebrated not only our achievements but also the bonds we had formed with our teachers and peers, marking the end of an unforgettable chapter in our lives. It was an outstanding event and one of the most memorable experiences I had ever been part of. This celebration held immense significance as it was our final gathering with all our batchmates. The event was filled with playful activities like color throwing, a signature show, dance performances, and a ramp show. We shared jokes, presented short films, and enjoyed every moment together. The color-throwing session was particularly fun, leaving us looking like ghosts wandering across the road. The event ended on a high note, with everyone dancing energetically, full of stamina and joy, creating unforgettable memories as we bid farewell to our cherished college days.
            In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly knocked on the door, bringing the world to a standstill. The sudden lockdowns and restrictions disrupted daily life, including my education, as classes shifted online and uncertainty loomed over academic timelines. Despite the challenges, I adapted to the new normal and continued my studies with determination. Finally, at the beginning of 2021, I accomplished a significant milestone by completing my bachelor's degree, marking the end of a 16-year educational journey. It was a moment of pride and relief, as I reflected on the perseverance and resilience it took to overcome the unprecedented obstacles posed by the pandemic. This achievement not only symbolized the culmination of years of hard work but also highlighted my ability to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity.</p>
